      o Insights and Results:
        By building the express project, I got familiar with MCV, CRUD, RESTful API concepts and how they worked.
        For the hands-on experience, I found it difficult to write and test express validation rules. In addition,
        to beautify the appearance of the web pages, I refer to the Bootstrap website. However, things were not easy
        at the beginning as I need to modified the code the pug format. I refer to the class demo and Bootstrap website
        to adjust the code as needed and then I overcame the chanllanges. Get the current timestamp is tricky, but I 
        converted it into ISO String format, changed it into Chicago timezone and then stored it into sqlite3 successfully.
